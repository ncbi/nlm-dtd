      <h1 class="sectiontitle">Implementing This Tag Set</h1>
      <p class="para">The Authoring Tag Set comprises a handful of Tag-Set-specific modules that set up parameter entity overrides and uses (by
         reference) the base modules of the full Journal Archiving and Interchange Suite. The modules of that Suite were developed
         as part of an effort to create XML applications through which materials on health-related disciplines could be shared and
         reused electronically. Although the full Suite was developed to support electronic production, the structures should be adequate
         to support some print production as well. The Suite has been used to construct many tag sets in addition to this one.
         
      </p>
      <p class="para">Because this is a Authoring Tag Set, thus optimized for creating new content, the Tag Set is far smaller (fewer elements,
         and fewer choices in many contexts) than either the Archiving or the Publishing Tag Sets. Where, in the Archiving Tag Set,
         there may have been several ways to express the same information, the goal was to allow only one way in this Authoring Tag
         Set. It was not the intention to limit the expressive power licensed by this Tag Set, but rather to limit the meaningless
         choices that a full interchange Tag Set needs to make to accommodate conversion from as wide a variety of formats as possible.
         The philosophy for the Archiving Tag Set was to accept as many varied forms of many structures as possible unchanged. The
         philosophy for the Publishing Tag Set was to accept a wide variety of structures and to regularize those that matter to the
         archive. The philosophy of this Authoring Tag Set is to prefer a single structural form, or at least a single style of tagging,
         whenever possible. Similarly the Archiving and Publishing Tag Sets allow for formatting such as list numbering and citation
         references to be preserved. This Tag Set assumes that such objects will need to be generated as part of production.

      <div class="section"><a name="imple-modulardesign"></a><h3 class="header">Modular DTD Design</h3>
         <p class="para">The Authoring Tag Set has been written as a set of DTD “modules” that make use of the modules of the Archiving and Interchange
            Suite. Each module is a separate physical file, no module is an entire DTD by itself, and modules can be combined into a number
            of different tag sets. The modules are separate physical files that, taken together, define all element structures (such as
            tables, math, chemistry, paragraphs, sections, figures, footnotes, and reference elements), as well as attributes and entities
            in the Suite. The module files are primarily intended for ease of constructing new tag sets and ease of maintenance.
            
         </p>
         <p class="para">Modules in the Suite are primarily intended to group elements for maintenance. There are different kinds of modules. A module
            may:
            
            <ul class="bullist">
               <li>Be a building block for a base tag set (such as the <a href="n-5sy0.html" target="main" title="%modules.ent;"><span class="pename">Module to Name the Modules</span></a> module)
                  
               </li>
               <li>Define the elements inside a particular structure. For example, the <a href="n-qwj0.html" target="main" title="%references.ent;"><span class="pename">Bibliography References (Citation) Elements Module</span></a> module names all the potential components of bibliographic reference lists.
                  
               </li>
               <li>Name the members of a “class” of elements, where class is a named grouping of elements that share a similar usage or potential
                  location. For example, the <a href="n-kmy0.html" target="main" title="%phrase.ent;"><span class="pename">Phrase-Level Content Elements Module</span></a> module defines small floating elements that may occur within text, such as inside a paragraph or a title, or that describe
                  textual content, for example, a disease name, drug name, or the name of a discipline.
                  
               </li>
               <li>Be a module of “editorial convenience”. For example, the <a href="n-v9d0.html" target="main" title="%common.ent;"><span class="pename">Common (Shared) Element Declarations Module</span></a> module holds elements and attributes used in the content models of the various class elements.
                  
               </li>
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <p class="para">The major disadvantage of a modular system is the longer learning curve, since it may not be immediately obvious <em>where</em> within the system to find a particular element or attribute cluster. To help with this, each element page includes an expanded
            content model and also names the module in which that element is defined.
         </p>
         <p class="para">There are many advantages to such a modular approach. The smaller units are written once, maintained in one place, and used
            in many different tag sets. This makes it much easier to keep lower level structures consistent across document types, while
            allowing for any real differences that analysis identifies. A tag set for a new function (such as a Repository Tag Set) or
            a new publication type can be built quickly, since most of the necessary components will already be defined in the Suite.
            Editorial and production personnel can bring the experience gained on one tagging project directly to the next with very little
            loss or retraining. Customized software (including authoring, typesetting, and electronic display tools) can be written once,
            shared among projects, and modified only for real distinctions.

      <div class="section"><a name="imple-how-to-start"></a><h3 class="header">How to Start Using This Tag Library</h3>
         <p class="para">If you want to learn about the Tag Set in order to write a new Tag Set based on this Tag Set or to modify this Tag Set:
            
            <ul class="bullist">
               <li>Skim the first two chapters of this Tag Library, the <a href="n-m000.html#chap-intro">How to Use</a> and the Tag Library <a href="n-cu00.html#gen-intro">General Introduction</a>.
                  
               </li>
               <li>Read the parameter entities that name the classes (the module <tt>default-classes.ent</tt>)
                  
               </li>
               <li>If you do not know the symbols used in the Document Hierarchy diagrams, then read the “<a href="n-ueq0.html#nearfar-key">Key to the Near &amp; Far® Diagrams</a>”.
                  
               </li>
               <li>Use the Document Hierarchy diagrams to give you a good sense of the top-level elements and their contents.
                  
               </li>
               <li>Pick an element from one of the diagrams (Look up the element in the Elements Section to find the full name of the element,
                  the definition, usage notes, content allowed, and attributes list. Look up one of the attributes to find its full name, usage
                  notes, and potential values.).
                  
               </li>
               <li>Read the DTD Modules. New tag sets are created by writing, at a minimum, a new DTD module and new
                  tag-set-specific customization modules, so you might want to read the modules in this order:
                  
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>The DTD itself <tt>articleauthoring.dtd</tt> and a few other modules.
                        
                     </li>
                     <li>The module that names all the Authoring-Tag-Set-specific customization and element modules (<a href="n-rm60.html" target="main" title="Module to Name Tag-Set-Specific Modules"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-modules.ent;</span></a>);
                        
                     </li>
                     <li>The module that names all the other modules in the Suite (<a href="n-5sy0.html" target="main" title="Module to Name the Modules"><span class="petag">%modules.ent;</span></a>);
                        
                     </li>
                     <li>The book customization modules (<a href="n-4960.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Class Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-classes.ent;</span></a>, <a href="n-j960.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Mix Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-mixes.ent;</span></a>, and <a href="n-um60.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Models/Attributes Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-models.ent;</span></a>);
                        <br class="br">You might also wish to familiarize yourself with the relationship between the “customization” modules and the “default” modules
                        for classes, mixes, and models, so you might read the Suite class and mix modules next (<a href="n-5dr0.html" target="main" title="Default Element Classes Module"><span class="petag">%default-classes.ent;</span></a> and <a href="n-rdr0.html" target="main" title="Default Element Mixes Module"><span class="petag">%default-mixes.ent;</span></a>);

         <div class="section"><a name="classes"></a><h4 class="header">Element Classes</h4>
            <p class="para">Many of the elements in the Authoring Tag Set have been grouped into loose element classes. There is no hard and fast rule
               for what constitutes a class; each one is a design decision, a matter of judgment. These classes are designed to ease customization
               to meet the particular needs of new tag sets. Base classes for the Archiving and Interchange Suite are defined in a separate
               <a href="n-5dr0.html" target="main" title="%default-classes.ent;"><span class="pename">Default Element Classes Module</span></a> (<a href="n-5dr0.html" target="main" title="Default Element Classes Module"><span class="petag">%default-classes.ent;</span></a>).
               
            </p>
            <p class="para">Content models are built using sequences of elements by element name, but OR groups typically do not use element names, ORs
               offer choices of classes (the usual) or mixes. As an example, the content model for a <a href="n-s4w0.html" target="main" title="<p&gt;"><span class="elementname">Paragraph</span></a> element is declared to be an OR group (that is, a choice) of <em>data characters</em> and any of the elements named in the <a href="n-eyy0.html" target="main" title="%p-elements;"><span class="pename">Paragraph Elements</span></a> mix (<a href="n-eyy0.html" target="main" title="Paragraph Elements"><span class="petag">%p-elements;</span></a>). The mix <a href="n-eyy0.html" target="main" title="Paragraph Elements"><span class="petag">%p-elements;</span></a> is declared to be a large OR group of many other element-defining classes: the <a href="n-6wd0.html" target="main" title="%block-display.class;"><span class="pename">Block Display Class Elements</span></a>, the <a href="n-98y0.html" target="main" title="%math.class;"><span class="pename">Mathematical Expressions Class Elements</span></a>, the <a href="n-w2y0.html" target="main" title="%list.class;"><span class="pename">List Class Elements</span></a>, the <a href="n-ahd0.html" target="main" title="%citation.class;"><span class="pename">Citation Class Elements</span></a>, et al.
               
            </p>
            <p class="para">Element classes can be viewed as building blocks used to build larger parameter entities for element mixes. (Note: A mix describes
               a usage circumstance for a group of elements, such as all the paragraph-level elements, all the elements allowed inside a
               table cell, all the elements inside a paragraph, or all the inline elements). For example, to add another block display item
               to the <a href="n-6wd0.html" target="main" title="%block-display.class;"><span class="pename">Block Display Class Elements</span></a>, you would edit the <a href="n-6wd0.html" target="main" title="Block Display Class Elements"><span class="petag">%block-display.class;</span></a> parameter entity in the Tag-Set-specific Article Authoring Class override Module to override the default parameter entity
               in the Suite’s <a href="n-5dr0.html" target="main" title="%default-classes.ent;"><span class="pename">Default Element Classes Module</span></a> module and create a new module containing the Element Declaration of the new block display item.

            <p class="para">Parameter entities are the major mechanism for customizing a tag set or creating a new tag set from the modules in the full
               Suite. Individual tag sets will be constructed by 1) establishing element and attribute combinations and content models using
               parameter entities in one of the Tag-Set-specific customizing modules and 2) choosing appropriate modules from the Suite that
               declare the elements needed. For example, if the base tag set contained 6 kinds of lists and 2 table models, a more specific
               tag set might use a Customize Classes Module to redefine the List Class to name only 3 lists and redefine the Display Class
               to allow only one table model.

               3) as many override modules (class, mix, and/or model) and new elements modules as necessary. Thus, typical modules for a
               new Tag Set are:
               
               <ul class="bullist">
                  <li>DTD — The DTD module (<tt>articleauthoring.dtd</tt>) for the new Tag Set base DTD (At a minimum, this module declares the top-level element (such as article, book, help-topic,
                     or report) and any other structural elements unique to the new document type.);
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>Tag-Set-specific Module of Modules — Module to name all the new modules created expressly for the new Tag Set;
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>Class overrides — Tag-Set-specific overrides of the Suite default element classes;
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>Mix overrides — Tag-Set-specific overrides of the Suite default class mixes;
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>Model overrides — Tag-Set-specific content model overrides for the content models in the modules of the suite (using “<tt>-elements</tt>” and “<tt>-model</tt>” parameter entities); and
                     
                  </li>
                  <li>New Model Modules — Tag-Set-specific new elements (for example, a new Book Tag Set might add book-specific metadata elements
                     or a Tag Set for historical material might add a module to define annotations.)

            <p class="para">PARAMETER ENTITY: SAME FUNCTION, SAME NAME — The Suite modules and initial DTDs have used a series of parameter entity naming
               conventions consistently. While parsing software cannot enforce these parameter entity naming or usage conventions, these
               conventions can make it much easier for a person to know how the content models work and what must be modified to make a Tag
               Set change.
               
            </p>
            <p class="para"><strong>CLASSES</strong> — Classes are functional groupings of elements used together in an OR group. Each class is named with a parameter entity,
               and all class parameter entity names end in the suffix “<tt>.class</tt>”:
               
            </p>

               class elements included.
               
            </p>
            <p class="para"><strong>MIXES</strong> — Mixes are functional OR groups of classes; mixes should never contain element names directly. All mixes must be declared
               after all classes, since mixes are composed of classes. Mix names have no set suffix; for example, they may end in “<tt>-mix</tt>” or “<tt>-elements</tt>”. Content models and content model overrides use mixes and classes for all OR groups. Only content model sequences are made
               up of element names directly.
               
            </p>
            <p class="para"><strong>MODEL OVERRIDES</strong> — parameter entity mixes for overriding a content model are of two styles: 1) inline mixes and 2) full content model replacements.
               These two groupings have been defined and named separately to preserve the mixed-content or element- content nature of the
               models in DTDs derived from the Suite.
               
            </p>
            <p class="para">The inline parameter entities to be intermingled with character data (<tt>#PCDATA</tt>) in a mixed content model are named with a suffix “<tt>-elements</tt>”. For example, “<tt>%institution-elements;</tt>” would be used in the content model for the element <a href="n-kua0.html" target="main" title="Institution Name: in an Address"><span class="elementtag">&lt;institution&gt;</span></a>:

               <p class="para">The basic idea for a new tag set is that all lower-level elements (paragraphs, lists, figures, etc.) will be defined in modules
                  — either the modules of the base Suite or in new tag-set-specific modules rather than in the DTD itself. The new DTD will
                  be fairly short and include only definitions of the topmost elements, at least the document element and maybe its children.
                  
               </p>
               <p class="para">Modules are declared using external parameter entities in the Suite’s <a href="n-5sy0.html" target="main" title="%modules.ent;"><span class="pename">Module to Name the Modules</span></a> or in the tag-set-specific Module of Modules. Modules are referenced in the DTD proper, <em>in the order needed</em> to define the parameter entities in sequence.
                  
               </p>
               <p class="para">This Authoring Tag Set was written as an example of the new best-practice customization technique. A new variant Tag Set that
                  follows this plan will probably consist of the following modules:
                  
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>A DTD module to define the top-level elements (for example, <tt>articleauthoring.dtd</tt>);
                        
                     </li>
                     <li>A Tag-Set-specific Module of Modules to name new non-Suite modules in the DTD (for example, <a href="n-rm60.html" target="main" title="Module to Name Tag-Set-Specific Modules"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-modules.ent;</span></a>);
                        
                     </li>
                     <li>A Tag-Set-specific definition of element classes to add new classes and override the default classes (for example, <a href="n-4960.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Class Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-classes.ent;</span></a>);

               <p class="para">To show the process, here is a series of instructions for making a new Tag Set, illustrated by showing how the Authoring Tag
                  Set was created from the modules of the whole Suite.
                  
                  <ol class="olist">
                     <li><strong>Modules</strong> — Write a new Tag-Set-specific Module of Modules, which defines all new customization modules the Tag Set needs. As an example,
                        the Authoring Tag Set created the module <a href="n-rm60.html" target="main" title="Module to Name Tag-Set-Specific Modules"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-modules.ent;</span></a>, which contains the definitions of the class-override module <a href="n-4960.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Class Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-classes.ent;</span></a>, the mix-override module <a href="n-j960.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Mix Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-mixes.ent;</span></a>, and the models-override module <a href="n-um60.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Models/Attributes Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-models.ent;</span></a>.
                        
                     </li>
                     <li><strong>Class overrides</strong> — Write a Tag-Set-specific class-override module, defining any overrides to the Suite classes. These classes are defined
                        in the default classes module, <tt>%default-classes.ent;</tt>. As an example, the Authoring Tag Set created the module <a href="n-4960.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Class Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-classes.ent;</span></a>, in which several new models, including <tt>%rest-of-para.class.class;</tt> and <tt>%name.class;</tt>, were declared.
                        
                     </li>
                     <li><strong>Mix overrides</strong> — Write a Tag-Set-specific mix-override module, defining any overrides to the Suite mixes. These mixes are defined in the
                        default mixes module, <tt>%default-mixes.ent;</tt>. As an example, the Authoring Tag Set created the module <a href="n-j960.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Mix Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-mixes.ent;</span></a>, in which mixes such as <tt>%emphasized-text;</tt> and <tt>%simple-phrase;</tt> were declared.
                        
                     </li>
                     <li><strong>Model overrides</strong> — Create a Tag-Set-specific content-model-override module, defining any overrides to the content models and attribute lists
                        for the Suite. As an example, the Authoring Tag Set created the module <a href="n-um60.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Models/Attributes Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-models.ent;</span></a>, in which element collections (suffixed “<tt>-elements</tt>”) that will be mixed with <tt>#PCDATA</tt> were redefined, full content models overrides (suffixed “<tt>-model</tt>”) were redefined, and some new attributes and attribute lists were added.
                        
                     </li>
                     <li><strong>New Elements</strong> — Write any new element modules needed. These will define any new block-level or phrase-level elements, for the Authoring
                        Tag Set, there are no such modules, but, for example, the Book Tag Set made from this Tag Set defines book-specific metadata.
                        
                     </li>
                     <li><strong>DTD Module</strong> — With those modules in place, construct a new DTD module. Within that module:
                        
                        <ul class="bullist">

                           <li>Use an external parameter entity reference to call the Suite default classes, for the Authoring Tag Set, the module <tt>%default-classes.ent;</tt>.
                              
                           </li>
                           <li>Use an external parameter entity reference to call the Tag-Set-specific mix overrides, for the Authoring Tag Set, the module

                           </li>
                           <li>Use an external parameter entity reference to call the Tag-Set-specific content models and attribute list overrides, for the
                              Authoring Tag Set, the module <a href="n-um60.html" target="main" title="Tag-Set-Specific Models/Attributes Customizations Module"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-models.ent;</span></a>.
                              
                           </li>
                           <li>Use an external parameter entity reference to call in the standard Common Module (<tt>%common.ent;</tt>) that defines elements and attributes so common they are used by many modules.
                              
                           </li>
                           <li>Use an external parameter entity reference to call any Tag-Set-specific module defining block-level or phrase-level elements.
                              For the Authoring Tag Set, there are no such modules, there are no such modules, but, for example, the Book Tag Set made from
                              the Suite defines book-specific metadata in the Book Metadata Module.
                              
                           </li>
                           <li>Select, from the Module of Modules, those modules which contain the elements needed for the Tag Set (for instance, selecting
                              lists and not selecting math elements) and calling in each of the modules needed. The Authoring Tag Set calls these in alphabetical
                              order, since the order does not matter.
                              
                           </li>
                           <li>Define the document element and any other unique elements and entities needed for this Tag Set. For example, the Authoring
                              Tag Set declares only four elements —  <tt>&lt;article&gt;</tt> [the top-level element] and its components: <tt>&lt;front&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>, and <tt>&lt;back&gt;</tt>.
