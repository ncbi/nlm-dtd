         <p class="para">A <a href="n-ize0.html" target="main" title="Sub-Article"><span class="elementtag">&lt;sub-article&gt;</span></a> is an article of any type (letter, reply, review, short new piece) which is entirely contained within another article.
         </p>
         <p class="para">The containing (main) article, the sub-article(s), or both, are often quite small. For example, an article titled “Member
            News Column” may contain one paragraph introducing the news items (main article) and then contain three longer news stories
            (sub-articles). An example of a longer article is a summary article which begins with a full review of the literature (main
            article) and includes several small related essays (sub-articles).
         </p>
         <p class="para">Many journals have regular columns such as “News”, “Book Reviews”, or “50 years ago in the journal”, which consist of a series
            of small entries grouped under a single article title. The group as a whole might have some introductory material in addition
            to the title. Each of these columns could be tagged as an article with the introductory material as its direct content and
            the various entries as sub-articles.
         </p>
         <p class="para">Sub-articles usually inherit all journal metadata (<a href="n-ykx0.html" target="main" title="Journal Metadata"><span class="elementtag">&lt;journal-meta&gt;</span></a>) from the parent article. The <a href="n-ize0.html" target="main" title="Sub-Article"><span class="elementtag">&lt;sub-article&gt;</span></a> element allows <a href="n-n7u0.html" target="main" title="Front Matter"><span class="elementtag">&lt;front&gt;</span></a> for the rare instance that the journal metadata is different from the parent article. Sub-articles also inherit the article’s
            metadata (<a href="n-c2c0.html" target="main" title="Article Metadata"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article-meta&gt;</span></a>) unless explicitly overridden by using the <a href="n-tfu0.html" target="main" title="<front-stub&gt;"><span class="elementname">Stub Front Metadata</span></a> element. For example, a sub-article may begin on a different page (<a href="n-vsu0.html" target="main" title="First Page"><span class="elementtag">&lt;fpage&gt;</span></a>) than the primary article or it may have different keywords. Usually the <a href="n-tfu0.html" target="main" title="<front-stub&gt;"><span class="elementname">Stub Front Metadata</span></a> of a sub-article is as small as possible, listing just the article metadata that is different for the sub-article, but a
            publisher or archive may choose to replicate most of the article metadata inside the sub-article for more accurate record
            keeping or retrieval. How much metadata goes with a sub-article is also a business decision.
         </p>
         <p class="para">The decision of whether one article should be bundled into another, and thus tagged as a sub-article rather than a full article
            in its own right, is subjective. Publishers and archives may wish to establish house guidelines for such decisions.
