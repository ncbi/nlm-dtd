The program is governed by a hierarchical cascade consisting of the transcription factors: &sigma;<sup>E</sup>, &sigma;<sup>K</sup>, GerE, GerR, and SpoIIID. The program consists of the activation and repression of 383 genes. The &sigma;<sup>E</sup> factor turns on 262 genes, including those for GerR and SpoIIID. These DNA-binding proteins downregulate almost half of the genes in the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> regulon. In addition, SpoIIID turns on ten genes, including genes involved in the appearance of &sigma;<sup>K</sup><sub>.</sub> Next, &sigma;<sup>K</sup> activates 75 additional genes, including that for GerE. This DNA-binding protein, in turn, represses half of the genes that had been activated by &sigma;<sup>K</sup> while switching on a final set of 36 genes. Evidence is presented that repression and activation contribute to proper morphogenesis. The program of gene expression is driven forward by its hierarchical organization and by the repressive effects of the DNA-binding proteins.

This challenge can be met in part through recent advances in transcriptional profiling, which have made it possible to catalog changes in gene expression on a genome-wide basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Brown1">Brown and Botstein 1999</xref>). However, most systems of development involve multiple differentiating cell types, complicating the challenge of deciphering the program of gene expression for individual cell types. Also, many developmental systems are insufficiently accessible to genetic manipulation to allow genome-wide changes in gene expression to be understood in detail in terms of an underlying regulatory program. An understanding of how a cell differentiates from one type into another requires both a comprehensive description of changes in gene expression and an elucidation of the underlying regulatory circuit that drives the program of gene expression. Here we report our efforts to comprehensively catalog the program of gene expression in a primitive system of cellular differentiation, spore formation in the bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> and to understand the logic of this program in terms of a simple regulatory circuit involving the ordered appearance of two RNA polymerase sigma factors and three positively and/or negatively acting DNA-binding proteins.</p>      <p>Spore formation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> involves the formation of an asymmetrically positioned septum that divides the developing cell (sporangium) into unequal-sized progeny that have dissimilar programs of gene expression and distinct fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Piggot1">Piggot and Coote 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Stragier2">Stragier and Losick 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Piggot2">Piggot and Losick 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Errington1">Errington 2003</xref>). The two progeny cells are called the forespore (the smaller cell) and the mother cell. Initially, the forespore and the mother cell lie side by side, but later in development the forespore is wholly engulfed by the mother cell, pinching it off as a cell within a cell. The forespore is a germ cell in that it ultimately becomes the spore and, upon germination, gives rise to vegetatively growing cells. The mother cell, on the other hand, is a terminally differentiating cell type that nurtures the developing spore but eventually undergoes lysis to liberate the fully ripened spore when morphogenesis is complete. The entire process of spore formation takes 7&ndash;8 h to complete with approximately 5 h of development taking place after the sporangium has been divided into forespore and mother-cell compartments.</p>      <p>Much is known about the transcription factors that drive the process of spore formation, and in several cases transcriptional profiling has been carried out to catalog genes switched on or switched off by individual sporulation regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Fawcett1">Fawcett et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Britton1">Britton et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Eichenberger2">Eichenberger et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Feucht1">Feucht et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Molle1">Molle et al. 2003a</xref>). Here we have attempted to go a step further by comprehensively elucidating the program of gene expression for a single cell type in the developing sporangium. For this purpose we focused on the mother cell and its 5-h program of gene expression. Gene expression in the mother cell is governed by five positively and/or negatively acting transcription factors. These are the sigma factors &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and &sigma;<sup>K</sup> and the DNA-binding proteins GerE, GerR (newly characterized in the present study), and SpoIIID.</p>      <p>The appearance of these regulatory proteins is governed by a hierarchical regulatory cascade of the form: &sigma;<sup>E</sup>&rarr;SpoIIID/GerR&rarr;&sigma;<sup>K</sup>&rarr;GerE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020328-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) in which &sigma;<sup>E</sup> is the earliest-acting factor specific to the mother-cell line of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Zheng2">Zheng and Losick 1990</xref>; results presented herein). The &sigma;<sup>E</sup> factor is derived from an inactive proprotein, pro-&sigma;<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-LaBell1">LaBell et al. 1987</xref>), whose synthesis commences before asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Satola1">Satola et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Baldus1">Baldus et al. 1994</xref>), but whose continued synthesis becomes strongly biased to the mother cell after asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Fujita1">Fujita and Losick 2002</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Fujita2">2003</xref>). Proteolytic conversion to mature &sigma;<sup>E</sup> takes place just after asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Stragier3">Stragier et al. 1988</xref>) and is triggered by an intercellular signal transduction pathway involving a secreted signaling protein that is produced in the forespore under the control of the forespore-specific transcription factor &sigma;<sup>F</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Hofmeister1">Hofmeister et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Karow1">Karow et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Londono-Vallejo1">Londono-Vallejo and Stragier 1995</xref>). Transcriptional profiling has established that &sigma;<sup>E</sup> turns on an unusually large regulon consisting of 262 genes, which are organized in 163 transcription units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Eichenberger2">Eichenberger et al. 2003</xref>; results presented herein). Among the targets of &sigma;<sup>E</sup> are the genes for the DNA-binding proteins SpoIIID and GerR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Kunkel1">Kunkel et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Stevens1">Stevens and Errington 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Tatti1">Tatti et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Wu1">Wu and Errington 2000</xref>; results presented herein). SpoIIID is both a negatively acting protein that switches off the transcription of certain genes that have been activated by &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and a positively acting protein that acts in conjunction with &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-containing RNA polymerase to switch on additional genes, including genes involved in the appearance of &sigma;<sup>K</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Kroos1">Kroos et al. 1989</xref>).</p>      <fig id="pbio-0020328-g001" position="float">        <label>Figure 1</label>        <caption>          <title>The Mother-Cell Line of Gene Transcription</title>          <p>(A) Gene transcription is governed by a hierarchical regulatory cascade that involves gene activation and gene repression. The &sigma;<sup>E</sup> factor turns on a large regulon that includes the genes for GerR and SpoIIID. These DNA-binding proteins, in turn, block further transcription of many of the genes that had been activated by &sigma;<sup>E</sup>. SpoIIID is also an activator, and it turns on genes required for the appearance of pro-&sigma;<sup>K</sup>. The conversion of pro-&sigma;<sup>K</sup> to mature &sigma;<sup>K</sup> is governed by a signal emanating from the forespore as represented by the squiggle. Next, &sigma;<sup>K</sup> activates the subsequent regulon in the cascade, which includes the gene for the DNA-binding protein GerE. Finally, GerE, which, like SpoIIID, is both an activator and a repressor, turns on the final regulon in the cascade while also repressing many of the genes that had been activated by &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. The thickness of lines represents the relative abundance of genes activated (arrows) or repressed (lines ending in bars) by the indicated regulatory proteins.</p>          <p>(B) The regulatory circuit is composed of two coherent FFLs linked in series and three incoherent FFLs. In the first coherent FFL, &sigma;<sup>E</sup> turns on the synthesis of SpoIIID, and both factors act together to switch on target genes, including genes involved in the appearance of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. Likewise, in the second coherent FFL, &sigma;<sup>K</sup> directs the synthesis of GerE, and the two factors then act together to switch on target genes (X<sub>4</sub>). The &sigma;<sup>E</sup> factor and SpoIIID also constitute an incoherent FFL in which SpoIIID acts as a repressor to downregulate the transcription of a subset of the genes (X<sub>2</sub>) that had been turned on by &sigma;<sup>E</sup>. Similar incoherent FFLs are created by the actions of &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and GerR (X<sub>1</sub>) and by &sigma;<sup>K</sup> and GerE (X<sub>3</sub>), with GerR and GerE repressing genes that had been switched on by &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and &sigma;<sup>K</sup>, respectively. The AND symbols indicate that the FFLs operate by the logic of an AND gate in that the output (either gene activation or a pulse of gene expression) requires the action of both transcription factors in the FFL (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Mangan1">Mangan and Alon 2003</xref>). For example, &sigma;<sup>K</sup> and GerE are both required for the activation of X<sub>4</sub> genes, whose induction is delayed compared to genes that are turned on by &sigma;<sup>K</sup> alone. Similarly, both &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and the delayed appearance of GerR are anticipated to create a pulse of transcription of X<sub>1</sub> genes.</p>        </caption>        <graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020328.g001.tif"/>      </fig>      <p>The appearance of &sigma;<sup>K</sup> is a critical control point that involves multiple levels of regulation: transcription, DNA recombination, and proprotein processing. SpoIIID both activates the transcription of the 5&prime; coding region for &sigma;<sup>K</sup> <italic>(spoIVCB)</italic> and that for a site-specific DNA recombinase <italic>(spoIVCA)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Kunkel2">Kunkel et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Halberg1">Halberg and Kroos 1994</xref>) that joins the 5&prime; coding sequence to the 3&prime; coding region by the excision of an intervening sequence of 48 kb called <italic>skin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Stragier4">Stragier et al. 1989</xref>). Finally, the product of the intact coding sequence is an inactive proprotein, pro-&sigma;<sup>K</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Kroos1">Kroos et al. 1989</xref>), whose conversion to mature &sigma;<sup>K</sup> (as in the case of pro-&sigma;<sup>E</sup>) is governed by a complex, intercellular signal transduction pathway involving a secreted signaling protein that is produced in the forespore under the control of the forespore-specific transcription factor &sigma;<sup>G</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Cutting3">Cutting et al. 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Cutting4">1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Lu2">Lu et al. 1990</xref>). The signal transduction pathway helps to coordinate the appearance of &sigma;<sup>K</sup> in the mother cell with the timing of events taking place in the forespore. The &sigma;<sup>K</sup> factor turns on an additional gene set that includes the gene for GerE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Cutting2">Cutting et al. 1989</xref>), a DNA-binding protein that is responsible for activating the final temporal class of genes in the mother-cell line of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Zheng1">Zheng et al. 1992</xref>).</p>      <p>Other than the case of &sigma;<sup>E</sup>, little was previously known about the full set of genes, whose transcription is governed by the five regulators in the mother-cell line of gene expression&mdash;indeed, nothing at all in the case of GerR, whose function had previously been uncharacterized. Here we present evidence indicating that the program of mother-cell-specific gene transcription involves the activation of at least 383 genes (242 transcription units), representing 9&percnt; of the genes in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> genome. We explain the pattern of transcription of each of these genes in terms of the action of the five regulatory proteins that govern the mother-cell program of gene transcription. Our results reveal that the program chiefly consists of a series of pulses in which large numbers of genes are turned on and are then turned off shortly thereafter by the action of the next regulatory protein in the hierarchy. Evidence is also presented that this repression is critical for proper morphogenesis. Finally, we show that the mother-cell program of gene transcription can be understood in terms of a simple regulatory circuit involving a linked series of feed-forward loops (FFLs) that are responsible for generating pulses of gene transcription. We propose that this regulatory circuit will serve as a model for understanding other programs of cellular differentiation.</p>    </sec>    <sec id="s2">      <title>Results</title>      <sec id="s2a">        <title>Transcriptional Profiling</title>        <p>Our strategy for elucidating the mother-cell program of gene transcription was to carry out transcriptional profiling at hourly intervals during sporulation at 37 &deg;C, starting just after asymmetric division and ending before the time at which lysis of the mother cell had commenced. At each time point, RNA from cells mutant for the transcriptional regulator that was maximally active at that time interval was compared against RNA from cells mutant for the next transcription factor in the hierarchy or, in the case of the last regulatory protein in the hierarchy, GerE, against RNA from wild-type cells. Thus, at hour 2.5, RNA from cells mutant for &sigma;<sup>E</sup> (strain PE437) was compared against RNA from cells (strain PE436) that were wild type for &sigma;<sup>E</sup> but mutant for the next regulatory protein in the sequence, SpoIIID. Likewise, at hour 3.5, RNA from cells that were mutant for SpoIIID (strain PE456) was compared against RNA from cells that were mutant for &sigma;<sup>K</sup> (strain PE452). (Strains PE456 and PE452 were additionally mutant for &sigma;<sup>G</sup> to eliminate indirect effects of the presence or absence of SpoIIID on the activity of the forespore-specific transcription factor. Although SpoIIID has no direct effect on &sigma;<sup>G</sup>, the absence of negative feedback on several &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled genes &lsqb;see below&rsqb; in the strain mutated for <italic>spoIIID</italic> could have had indirect consequences on &sigma;<sup>G</sup> activity.) Likewise, at hour 4.5, RNA from cells that were mutant for &sigma;<sup>K</sup> (strain PE455) was compared against RNA from cells mutant for GerE (strain PE454). Finally, at hours 5.5 and 6.5, RNA from cells mutant for GerE was compared against RNA from wild-type cells (PY79). Three transcriptional-profiling analyses were carried out for each of these time points, using three independent preparations of RNA from each of the two cultures of cells that were being compared against each other.

SpoIIID is a DNA-binding protein that acts in conjunction with &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-containing RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Kroos1">Kroos et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Kunkel1">Kunkel et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Halberg1">Halberg and Kroos 1994</xref>). Therefore, as a starting point for the present study, we investigated the influence of SpoIIID on the global pattern of &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-directed transcription. As we shall see, this analysis revealed ten genes (representing eight transcription units) that were strongly dependent upon SpoIIID for expression and were not expressed under the control of &sigma;<sup>E</sup> alone<bold>,</bold> bringing the present total number of genes in the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> regulon to 272 and the total number of transcription units to 171 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020328-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s2c">        <title>SpoIIID Is Both a Repressor and an Activator of Genes Whose Transcription Is Dependent Upon &sigma;<sup>E</sup></title>        <p>Transcriptional profiling revealed that SpoIIID had profound effects on the global pattern of &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-directed gene transcription. As many as 181 genes were found to be downregulated in the presence of SpoIIID.

At least 70 genes were identified whose transcription was upregulated by SpoIIID (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>), but in many cases these genes were not members of the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> regulon, and the effect of SpoIIID could have been indirect. Examples are seven genes <italic>(cysK , cysH, cysP, sat, cysC, yoaD,</italic> and <italic>yoaB)</italic> from the S-box regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Grundy1">Grundy and Henkin 1998</xref>) and two genes <italic>(argC</italic> and <italic>argJ)</italic> from the arginine biosynthesis operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Smith3">Smith et al. 1989</xref>). In other cases, however, SpoIIID stimulated or activated the transcription of genes that had been reported to be under the control of &sigma;<sup>E</sup>.

Thus, in addition to repressing at least 112 members of the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> regulon, SpoIIID activates the transcription of 25 other members of the regulon, representing 19 transcription units.

It was therefore important to determine whether the genes so affected were direct targets of the DNA-binding protein. For this purpose, we used three complementary approaches to identifying binding sites for SpoIIID: biochemical analysis by gel electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) and DNAase I footprinting, in vivo analysis by chromatin-immunoprecipitation in combination with gene microarrays (ChIP-on-chip), and the identification of SpoIIID-binding sequences by computational analysis.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s2d">        <title>Biochemical Identification of SpoIIID-Binding Sites</title>        <p>We selected 18 of the newly identified SpoIIID-regulated genes for EMSA analysis, mostly on the basis of the importance of their role in sporulation.

The <italic>cotE</italic> gene is transcribed from two promoters: a &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled promoter called P1 and a second promoter called P2 that strongly depends on SpoIIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Zheng2">Zheng and Losick 1990</xref>). It had been assumed that transcription from P2 is under the dual control of &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and SpoIIID, but EMSA analysis failed to reveal a binding site for SpoIIID, and other work presented below indicates that transcription from <italic>cotE</italic> P2 is governed by &sigma;<sup>K</sup> rather than by &sigma;<sup>E</sup>. We conclude that the SpoIIID dependence of <italic>cotE</italic> P2 is an indirect consequence of the dependence of &sigma;<sup>K</sup> synthesis on SpoIIID.</p>        <p>To obtain further evidence for direct interaction by SpoIIID and to investigate the mechanism by which SpoIIID inhibits transcription, we subjected the promoter regions of three genes <italic>(spoIID, spoIIIAA,</italic> and <italic>spoVE)</italic> identified as being under the negative control of SpoIIID to DNAase I footprinting analysis. SpoIIID protected two regions in the upstream sequence of <italic>spoIID</italic> from DNAase I digestion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). One region (extending from positions &minus;10 to &minus;28 on the top strand and from &minus;18 to &minus;35 on the bottom strand) overlapped with the &minus;10 element of the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> promoter, and the other (extending from &minus;33 to &minus;52 on the top strand) overlapped with the &minus;35 element. The binding site for SpoIIID also overlapped with the promoter in the case of <italic>spoIIIAA,</italic> in this case protecting a single sequence that included the &minus;35 element (extending from &minus;21 to &minus;45 on the top strand and from &minus;30 to &minus;48 on the bottom strand). Finally, the regulatory sequence of <italic>spoVE</italic> exhibited two binding sites, one (extending from &plus;16 to &minus;1 on the bottom strand) that was located in the vicinity of the predominant &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled promoter (P2) for this gene and another further upstream, overlapping with a secondary promoter (P1) (extending from &plus;13 to &minus;7 on the top strand). Thus, repression of the promoters of <italic>spoIID, spoIIIAA,</italic> and <italic>spoVE</italic> by SpoIIID is likely to be a direct consequence of the binding of the sporulation regulatory protein to the promoter in such a way as to compete with binding by &sigma;<sup>E</sup>&ndash;RNA polymerase.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s2e">        <title>SpoIIID Binds to Some Sites that Do Not Correspond to Genes under Its Control</title>        <p>ChIP-on-chip analysis was carried out as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Molle1">Molle et al. 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Molle2">2003b</xref>), using DNA&ndash;protein complexes from formaldehyde-treated cells at hour 3 of sporulation. After sonication, SpoIIID&ndash;DNA complexes were precipitated with antibodies against SpoIIID. Next, after reversal of the cross-links, the precipitated DNAs were amplified by PCR in the presence of cyanine 5-dUTP. In parallel, total sonicated DNA from the formaldehyde-treated cells (i.e., DNA that had not been subjected to immunoprecipitation) was similarly amplified, but in the presence of cyanine 3-dUTP. The two differentially labeled DNAs were combined and hybridized to the same batch of DNA microarrays that were used for the transcriptional-profiling experiments. Transcriptional profiling was carried out with three independent preparations of formaldehyde-treated cells, twice with two of the preparations and once with the third, for a total of five analyses. An enrichment factor was calculated for each gene, representing the enrichment of that gene by immunoprecipitation relative to DNA that had not been subjected to immunoprecipitation, and the entire dataset is displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st003">Table S3</xref>.</p>        <p>Thirty-one genes, corresponding to 26 regions of the chromosome, were found to be enriched by immunoprecipitation by a factor of two or greater. Only seven of the regions <italic>(cotF, lip, spoIIIAF, spoVD, ycgF, yhbH,</italic> and <italic>ykvI)</italic> identified by the ChIP-on-chip analysis were in close proximity to a gene that was differentially expressed in the SpoIIID transcriptional-profiling experiments. Thus, in only a small number of cases did ChIP-on-chip analysis support the idea that a gene under SpoIIID control was a direct target of the DNA-binding protein. Our interpretation of these findings is that ChIP-on-chip is less sensitive for detecting SpoIIID-binding sites than it is for the <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> DNA-binding proteins CodY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Molle2">Molle et al. 2003b</xref>), Spo0A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Molle1">Molle et al. 2003a</xref>), and RacA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Ben-Yehuda1">Ben-Yehuda et al. 2003</xref>). Likely contributing to this decreased sensitivity is the fact that SpoIIID is present in only one of the two chromosome-containing compartments (the mother cell) of the sporangium and that its concentration is low (&sim;1 &mu;M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Zhang1">Zhang et al. 1997</xref>).</p>        <p>While providing support for only a small proportion of the herein identified targets of SpoIIID regulation, ChIP-on-chip analysis, nonetheless, proved to be revealing. Specifically, we found that SpoIIID bound to many regions of the chromosome that did not correspond to genes under its negative or positive control. Were these regions bona fide SpoIIID-binding sites? To address this question, we subjected five regions that were most enriched for SpoIIID-binding <italic>(albE</italic>&ndash;<italic>albF, dctR</italic>&ndash;<italic>dctP, tenI</italic>&ndash;<italic>goxB</italic>&ndash;<italic>thiS, treA</italic>&ndash;<italic>treR&ndash;yfkO,</italic> and <italic>yfmC&ndash;yfmD)</italic> to EMSA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020328-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Given that SpoIIID was not exerting a transcriptional effect in these regions, we reasoned that the sites to which SpoIIID was binding might not reside in upstream regulatory regions and could instead be located in coding sequences. We therefore scanned across each of the five chromosomal regions by EMSA using successive DNA fragments of about 400 bp in length. The results showed that each of the five regions contained more than one binding site for SpoIIID and that some of these binding sites were indeed located within protein-coding sequences. (The presence of more than one binding site in each region may have facilitated their detection by the ChIP-on-chip analysis.) We conclude that SpoIIID binds to some sites on the chromosome at which it does not function as a transcriptional regulator. Conceivably, it plays an architectural role in the folding of the chromosome in the mother cell in addition to its role as a transcriptional regulator. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Moqtaderi1">Moqtaderi and Struhl (2004)</xref> have similarly found that in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> the RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC binds to sites where binding of other components of the RNA polymerase III machinery is not detected and where the transcription factor does not activate transcription.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s2f">        <title>Identification of Putative SpoIIID-Binding Sites by Bioinformatics</title>        <p>As a final, computational approach to identifying direct targets of SpoIIID, we used the Gibbs sampling algorithm BioProspector to identify conserved motifs in sequences upstream of genes under the control of SpoIIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Liu1">Liu et al. 2001</xref>). Initially, we limited our search to 40 regions where SpoIIID binding had been confirmed by biochemical analysis. BioProspector was used to find the best 35 motifs across several different widths (6&ndash;12 bp) under the restriction that every sequence had to contain at least one site. Each of these motifs was separately used as a starting point for BioOptimizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Jensen1">Jensen and Liu 2004</xref>) and applied to an expanded dataset that included the 89 upstream sequences for all SpoIIID-controlled genes (not just those analyzed by EMSA or footprinting). BioOptimizer optimized both the set of predicted sites and the motif width, as detailed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section. BioOptimizer was required to identify at least one binding site in the sequences that had been confirmed by EMSA but was unrestricted for the sequences for which a binding site had not been confirmed biochemically.

As we have demonstrated, GerR is responsible for repressing <italic>yqhV,</italic> which is located just upstream of the <italic>spoIIIA</italic> operon. Given the absence of an apparent transcriptional terminator at the end of the gene, &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-directed transcription from <italic>yqhV</italic> is likely to read into <italic>spoIIIA,</italic> which is also transcribed from its own &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled promoter located in the intergenic region between <italic>yqhV</italic> and the operon. Thus, by repressing <italic>yqhV,</italic> GerR would inhibit read-through transcription into <italic>spoIIIA</italic>. Indeed, our transcriptional-profiling analysis revealed a small negative effect of GerR on <italic>spoIIIA</italic> transcription. Meanwhile, SpoIIID acts at the promoter for the <italic>spoIIIA</italic> operon to inhibit it from being used by &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-RNA polymerase. Thus, maximum repression of <italic>spoIIIA</italic> is evidently achieved by the combined action of GerR and SpoIIID, each acting to block different promoters.</p>        <p>Finally, we note that GerR inhibited the expression of a large number of genes that do not belong to the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> regulon. Interestingly, many of these genes are organized in large clusters, such as <italic>azlB&ndash;azlC&ndash;azlD&ndash;bnrQ&ndash;yrdK&ndash;gltR, albA&ndash;albB&ndash;albC&ndash;albD, yefA&ndash;yefB&ndash;yefC&ndash;yeeA&ndash;yeeB&ndash;yeeC, yjcM&ndash;yjcN&ndash;yjcO,</italic> and <italic>yydB&ndash;yydC&ndash;yydD&ndash;yydG&ndash;yydH&ndash;yyd &ndash;yydJ</italic>. The genes found in these clusters rarely belong to a single transcription unit and are sometimes transcribed in opposite directions (either convergently or divergently).</p>        <p>In summary, transcription of genes in the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> regulon is in part self-limiting. The &sigma;<sup>E</sup> factor induces the synthesis of two proteins, GerR and SpoIIID, that act to switch off other genes in the regulon, thereby preventing their continued transcription during the next stage of the mother-cell line of gene expression.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s2h">        <title>The &sigma;<sup>K</sup> Regulon</title>        <p>Next, we used two complementary transcriptional-profiling approaches to identify genes under the control of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>, an RNA polymerase sigma factor that follows SpoIIID in the hierarchical regulatory cascade. In one approach, we sought to identify genes that were upregulated during sporulation in a &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-dependent (but not a GerE-dependent) manner. In the other approach, we sought to identify genes whose transcription was artificially activated in cells engineered to produce &sigma;<sup>K</sup> during growth. For this approach we used a strain in which the coding sequence for the mature form of the transcription factor (&sigma;<sup>K</sup> is normally derived by proteolytic processing from an inactive proprotein &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Kroos1">Kroos et al. 1989</xref>&rsqb;) was under the control of an inducible promoter (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Ninety-five genes were identified that were induced both during growth and sporulation in a &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-dependent manner. Eight additional genes <italic>(cotA, cotE, cotM</italic>, <italic>gerE, gerPA, yfhP, yjcZ</italic>, and <italic>ykuD)</italic> that had previously been assigned to the regulon on the basis of gene-specific analysis were added to the tally, bringing the total to 103 (and representing 63 transcription units). These eight genes were cases in which we did not obtain a statistically significant score in one or the other of the two transcriptional-profiling approaches or for which a signal was not obtained for technical reasons (e.g., the strain used was mutant for <italic>gerE</italic> and <italic>yjcZ</italic> had not been annotated when the arrays were built). The list of 103 did not include &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-controlled genes whose transcription additionally and strongly required the DNA-binding protein GerE. Some (28) of these 103 genes were also transcribed under the control of &sigma;<sup>E</sup> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020328-t002">Table 2</xref>), leaving a total of 75 genes that were newly activated during sporulation under the control of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. As we shall see, when genes that were strongly dependent on GerE are included (41 genes, five of which were also expressed under the control of &sigma;<sup>E</sup>), the size of the regulon increases to 144 genes (103 &plus; 41) organized in 94 transcription units (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020328-t002">Table 2</xref>). A map of the &sigma;<sup>K</sup> regulon is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020328-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and a detailed list of the genes in the regulon is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref>.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s2i">        <title>Identification of Promoters Controlled by &sigma;<sup>K</sup> Using Bioinformatics and Transcriptional Start Site Mapping</title>        <p>As a further approach to assessing our assignments to the &sigma;<sup>K</sup> regulon, we used BioProspector and BioOptimizer to obtain a consensus sequence for promoters under the control of the sporulation transcription factor. The computational approach was complicated by the fact that the program had to find a two-block motif, with the first block corresponding to the &minus;35 element and the second block to the &minus;10 element separated by a gap of fixed length (&plus;/&minus; one nucleotide). The dataset consisted of 76 upstream sequences (the upstream sequences of transcription units that were strongly dependent on GerE were not included). The optimized motif with the best score identified 58 promoters and was composed of a five-nucleotide-long &minus;35 element and a ten-nucleotide long &minus;10 element, separated by a gap of 14&ndash;16 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020328-g004">Figure 4</xref>D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Jensen1">Jensen and Liu 2004</xref>) To assess the validity of the predicted consensus sequence for &sigma;<sup>K</sup> promoters, we mapped the transcription start sites of 18 of the newly identified targets of &sigma;<sup>K</sup> by 5&prime; rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends&ndash;PCR (RACE&ndash;PCR). The results of the mapping experiments are displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>. The newly identified &sigma;<sup>K</sup> promoters were combined with the promoter sequences of 23 previously mapped &sigma;<sup>K</sup> promoters to obtain an updated consensus sequence corresponding to a total of 41 promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020328-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). The logo for &sigma;<sup>K</sup> promoters whose start sites had been mapped was very similar to the logo obtained by the BioProspector/BioOptimizer procedure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020328-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Moreover, out of the 41 confirmed &sigma;<sup>K</sup> promoters, the correct promoter was identified in 24 cases, with no prediction being made in 15 cases and an incorrect prediction in just two cases. All of the predicted sites are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref>.</p>        <p>The &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and &sigma;<sup>K</sup> factors are highly similar to each other, and the promoters they recognize are also very similar. The availability of updated logos for both categories of promoters based on the nearly complete regulons for both regulatory proteins provided an opportunity to revisit the issue of how the two regulatory proteins discriminate between their two classes of cognate promoters. A comparison of the motif recognized by &sigma;<sup>K</sup> to that recognized by &sigma;<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020328-g004">Figure 4</xref>F) reveals that both classes of promoters share identical &minus;10 sequences and that the &minus;35 elements differ by a single base pair: a cytosine in the fourth position of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-controlled promoters versus a thymine at the corresponding position in &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled promoters. These results reinforce the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Tatti2">Tatti et al. (1995)</xref> who identified glutamine 217 of &sigma;<sup>E</sup> as the contact residue for the base pair at position 4. The two proteins are identical to each other in the region inferred to interact with the &minus;35 element except for the presence of arginine instead of glutamine at the corresponding position in &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. Moreover, replacing glutamine 217 with arginine was found to confer on &sigma;<sup>E</sup> the capacity to recognize &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-controlled promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Tatti2">Tatti et al. 1995</xref>). The high similarity between the two classes of promoters also helps to explain why some &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-controlled promoters are also recognized by &sigma;<sup>E</sup>, but our bioinformatics analysis does not allow us to explain why some promoters are recognized exclusively by one or the other sigma factor and others are not.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s2j">        <title>GerE Is Both a Repressor and an Activator of Genes Whose Transcription Is Dependent upon &sigma;<sup>K</sup></title>        <p>The last regulator in the mother-cell line of gene expression is the DNA-binding protein GerE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Cutting2">Cutting et al. 1989</xref>). Genes under GerE control were identified by transcriptional-profiling experiments carried out at two times (5.5 h and 6.5 h) late in sporulation. Strikingly, as many as 209 genes were downregulated in the presence of GerE at one or both time points, with many more genes being downregulated at the later time point (201 versus 61; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Some of these downregulated genes (55) were members of the &sigma;<sup>K</sup> regulon, with 29 being downregulated at the earlier time point and an additional 26 at the later time point. Thus, GerE is responsible for inhibiting the expression of 53&percnt; of the genes in the &sigma;<sup>K</sup> regulon, but its repressive effects are not limited to genes under &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. We note that the gene coding for &sigma;<sup>K</sup> is itself repressed by GerE, which would be expected to curtail further synthesis of the mother-cell sigma factor late in sporulation. Thus, GerE has a wide impact in inhibiting gene transcription late in the process of spore maturation, including many genes in the preceding regulon of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-activated genes.</p>        <p>At the same time, GerE is also an activator that stimulated or switched on the transcription of as many as 65 genes by hour 5.5 and 71 genes by hour 6.5. Of these, 41 were strongly dependent upon GerE for their expression and hence were not identified as members of the &sigma;<sup>K</sup> regulon. Leaving aside genes that were members of both the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and &sigma;<sup>K</sup> regulons (five), we see that GerE is responsible for turning on an additional 36 genes (27 transcription units) in the final phase of the mother-cell line of gene expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020328-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s2k">        <title>Evidence that SpoIIID-Mediated Repression Is Required for Sporulation</title>        <p>As we have seen, a striking feature of the mother-cell line of gene expression is that many of the genes activated by one transcription factor are turned off by the next-appearing regulatory protein in the cascade. Thus, most of the genes that are turned on by &sigma;<sup>E</sup> are subsequently repressed by GerR or SpoIIID. Likewise, many of the genes activated by &sigma;<sup>K</sup> are, in turn, downregulated by GerE. In the case of GerR, a mutant lacking the regulatory protein produced spores that were defective in germination. Hence, proper morphogenesis depends on the capacity of GerR, which appears to act exclusively as a repressor, to turn off genes under its control.</p>        <p>The case of SpoIIID is more complex because in addition to its role as a repressor this DNA-binding protein is also an activator of two genes, <italic>spoIVCA</italic> and <italic>spoIVCB,</italic> that are essential for sporulation because of their role in the synthesis of &sigma;<sup>K</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Halberg1">Halberg and Kroos 1994</xref>). To investigate the role of SpoIIID-mediated repression in spore formation, we created a construct in which a copy of the intact pro-&sigma;<sup>K</sup> coding sequence, <italic>sigK,</italic> was introduced into the <italic>amyE</italic> locus, thereby bypassing the requirement for the <italic>spoIVCA</italic>-encoded recombinase, which is normally needed for creating <italic>sigK</italic> by a chromosomal rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Stragier4">Stragier et al. 1989</xref>), and for <italic>spoIVCB,</italic> the 5&prime; portion of the coding sequence that participates in the rearrangement. In our construct, the insertion of <italic>sigK</italic> at <italic>amyE</italic> was under the direction of a &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled promoter that is not dependent upon SpoIIID for its activation (the promoter for <italic>spoIVF;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Cutting5">Cutting et al. 1991b</xref>). The <italic>amyE</italic>::P<italic><sub>spoIVF</sub>&ndash;sigK</italic> construct was introduced into <italic>spoIVCB</italic> mutant cells to create strain BDR1663. Even though pro-&sigma;<sup>K</sup> was expected to be synthesized somewhat prematurely in BDR1663, the appearance of mature &sigma;<sup>K</sup> remained subject to the pathway governing the proteolytic processing of pro-&sigma;<sup>K</sup> and hence would have occurred at the normal time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Cutting4">Cutting et al. 1991a</xref>).

We conclude that bypassing the requirement for SpoIIID in &sigma;<sup>K</sup> synthesis does not measurably affect sporulation efficiency.</p>        <table-wrap id="pbio-0020328-t003"

A possible explanation for these results is that, in addition to its role in &sigma;<sup>K</sup> synthesis, SpoIIID is required for the synthesis of some other unidentified protein or proteins that are needed for sporulation. To investigate this possibility, we systematically inactivated all of the newly identified SpoIIID-activated transcription units (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020328-t003">Table 3</xref>). With three exceptions, those of <italic>spoVK, asnO,</italic> and <italic>ycgM,</italic> the resulting mutants sporulated at levels comparable to that of the wild type. In the case of <italic>spoVK, asnO,</italic> and <italic>ycgM,</italic> evidence suggests that each is transcribed in both a SpoIIID-dependent and a SpoIIID-independent mode. Thus, <italic>spoVK</italic> is transcribed from both a &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled (P1) and a &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-controlled (P2) promoter, and it is known that P1 is dispensable for sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Foulger1">Foulger and Errington 1991</xref>). Experiments based on the use of cells engineered to produce &sigma;<sup>K</sup> during growth indicate that <italic>asnO</italic> is capable of being transcribed under the direction of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. Finally, it has been shown that <italic>ycgM</italic> is induced during the early stages of sporulation under the control of Spo0A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Molle1">Molle et al. 2003a</xref>), and so at least some YcgM protein should be present in a <italic>spoIIID</italic> mutant. Besides, complete inactivation of <italic>ycgM</italic> resulted in a sporulation defect that is less severe than that observed for strain BDR1666.</p>        <p>These results do not rule out the possibility that SpoIIID activates the transcription of one or more genes in addition to <italic>spoIVCA</italic> and <italic>spoIVCB</italic> that are needed for sporulation. Nevertheless, the simplest interpretation of our findings is that the strong sporulation defect of strain BDR1666 is due to a failure in gene turn off rather than gene activation.</p>      </sec>    </sec>    <sec id="s3">      <title>Discussion</title>      <sec id="s3a">        <title>The Mother-Cell Line of Gene Transcription Is a Hierarchical Regulatory Cascade That Is Subject to Successive Negative Regulatory Loops</title>        <p>Our results reveal the almost complete program of gene transcription for a single differentiating cell type, the mother-cell compartment of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> sporangium. The mother cell is a terminally differentiating cell that ultimately undergoes lysis (programmed cell death) when its contribution to the maturation of the spore is complete. Its program of transcription is played out over the course of about 5 h and, as we have shown, involves the activation in a cell-type-specific manner of 383 genes, which are grouped together in 242 transcription units. This corresponds to 9&percnt; of the 4,106 annotated protein-coding genes in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> genome. The transcription of these 383 genes is orchestrated by five developmental regulatory proteins: two RNA polymerase sigma factors, &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and &sigma;<sup>K</sup>, and three DNA-binding proteins, SpoIIID, GerE, and a previously uncharacterized regulatory protein, GerR. The five regulatory proteins are organized in a hierarchical regulatory cascade of the form: &sigma;<sup>E</sup>&rarr;SpoIIID/GerR&rarr;&sigma;<sup>K</sup> &rarr;GerE. The earliest-acting regulatory protein in the cascade, &sigma;<sup>E</sup>, turns on the transcription of 262 genes (163 transcription units), including the genes for GerR and SpoIIID. GerR and SpoIIID, in turn, acting as repressors, downregulate further transcription of almost half of the genes in the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> regulon. In addition, however, SpoIIID, acting in conjunction with &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-containing RNA polymerase, turns on the transcription of ten genes (eight transcription units), including genes involved in the appearance of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. Next, &sigma;<sup>K</sup> activates 75 additional genes (44 transcription units). Among the members of the &sigma;<sup>K</sup> regulon is the gene for the final regulatory protein in the cascade GerE. Strikingly, GerE represses the transcription of over half of the genes that have been activated by &sigma;<sup>K</sup> while switching on 36 additional genes (27 transcription units), the final temporal class in the mother-cell line of gene transcription. Thus, the program of gene expression is driven forward by its hierarchical organization as well as by the successive, repressive effects of the DNA-binding proteins, which inhibit continued transcription of many genes that had been activated earlier in the cascade. Indeed, evidence presented herein is consistent with the idea that repression by GerR and SpoIIID contributes to proper sporulation, modestly in the case of GerR, and perhaps more significantly in the case of SpoIIID.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s3b">        <title>The Mother-Cell Line of Gene Transcription Is Governed by a Linked Series of Coherent and Incoherent FFLs</title>        <p>Transcription networks are based on recurring circuit modules, one of the most common of which is the FFL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Milo1">Milo et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Shen-Orr1">Shen-Orr et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Mangan1">Mangan and Alon 2003</xref>). FFLs are simple circuits involving two regulatory proteins in which one (the primary regulatory protein) governs the synthesis of the other and both then control the expression of a set of target genes. Certain types of FFLs known as type 1 are particularly prevalent because of their favorable biological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Shen-Orr1">Shen-Orr et al. 2002</xref>). In type-1 FFLs, the primary regulatory protein acts positively on the synthesis of the second. The mother-cell line of gene transcription is based on two kinds of type-1 FFLs known as a &ldquo;coherent&rdquo; and &ldquo;incoherent.&rdquo; In coherent type-1 FFLs, both regulatory proteins act positively on target genes, whereas in incoherent type-1 FFLs, the primary regulatory protein acts positively and the second acts negatively.</p>        <p>Using this nomenclature, we see that the hierarchical regulatory cascade that governs the mother-cell line of gene transcription is a circuit composed of two coherent type-1 FFLs linked in series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020328-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, &sigma;<sup>E</sup> turns on the synthesis of SpoIIID, and both transcription factors then act jointly to turn on target genes, including genes involved in the appearance of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. The FFL is acting by the logic of an AND gate in that both &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and SpoIIID are required for the expression of target genes. This first FFL is linked in series to a second coherent type-1 FFL in which &sigma;<sup>K</sup> turns on the synthesis of GerE, and the two transcription factors then collaborate to activate the transcription of target genes (the terminal temporal class of gene transcription in the mother cell). Once again this is an AND gate in that both &sigma;<sup>K</sup> and GerE are required for the activation of target genes. Simulation studies show that coherent type-1 FFLs have the property of being persistence detectors in which the activation of target genes depends on the persistence of the primary regulatory protein (&sigma;<sup>E</sup> and &sigma;<sup>K</sup>) and &ldquo;rejects&rdquo; situations in which the primary regulatory protein is present only transiently in its active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Mangan1">Mangan and Alon 2003</xref>).</p>        <p>The mother-cell line of gene transcription is also governed by three incoherent type-1 FFLs, involving SpoIIID, GerR, and GerE, each acting in this context as repressors. Thus, &sigma;<sup>E</sup> turns on the synthesis of SpoIIID, which in turn represses a subset of the genes that have been turned on by the primary regulatory protein. The &sigma;<sup>E</sup> factor similarly turns on the synthesis of GerR, which then represses a largely nonoverlapping subset of the genes that have been activated by &sigma;<sup>E</sup>. Finally, the &sigma;<sup>K</sup> factor turns on the synthesis of GerE, which then acts to downregulate the transcription of many of the genes that have been switched on by &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. Simulations have shown that incoherent type-1 FFLs have the property of producing a pulse of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Mangan1">Mangan and Alon 2003</xref>). Incoherent type-1 FFLs also operate by the logic of an AND gate in that pulses of gene transcription require the action of both the activator and the delayed appearance of the repressor.</p>        <p>Viewing the mother-cell line of gene transcription in terms of an interconnected series of FFLs reveals an underlying logic to the mother-cell program of gene expression. The use of coherent type-1 FFLs to drive the activation of successive sets of genes and the ordered appearance of regulatory proteins may help to minimize noise and to ensure that each temporal class of gene activation is tightly tied to the persistence of the previously acting regulatory proteins in the sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Mangan2">Mangan et al. 2003</xref>). Meanwhile, the use of incoherent type-1 FFLs to switch off the transcription of genes in previously activated gene sets helps to generate pulses of gene transcription in which certain genes, whose products may only be required transiently during differentiation, are transcribed over a limited period of time. Indeed, as we now consider, genes with related functions are often transcribed coordinately in a pulse, the timing of which corresponds to the function of their products.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s3c">        <title>Coordinated Expression of Functionally Related Genes</title>        <p>The mother-cell program of gene expression is characterized, as we have seen, by pulses of gene expression in which different sets of genes are successively switched on and then switched off. In some cases, these pulses correspond to the expression of genes with related functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020328-t004">Table 4</xref>). This can be most clearly seen with the gene set that is activated by &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and repressed by SpoIIID or GerR, which includes genes involved in engulfment, cortex formation, and the appearance of &sigma;<sup>G</sup> and &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. Thus, three genes that are responsible for driving engulfment, <italic>spoIID</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Lopez-Diaz1">Lopez-Diaz et al. 1986</xref>), <italic>spoIIM</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Smith1">Smith and Youngman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Smith2">Smith et al. 1993</xref>), and <italic>spoIIP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Frandsen1">Frandsen and Stragier 1995</xref>), are coordinately activated by &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and then repressed by SpoIIID (in the case of <italic>spoIID</italic>) or by GerR (in the case of the other two). Likewise, all of the &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled genes that are known to be required for spore cortex formation (<italic>cwlD, dacB&ndash;spmAB, spoIVA, spoVB, spoVD, spoVE, yabPQ, ykvUV, ylbJ,</italic> and <italic>yqfCD;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Piggot2">Piggot and Losick 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Eichenberger2">Eichenberger et al. 2003</xref>) are repressed by SpoIIID. Yet another example is the eight-gene <italic>spoIIIA</italic> operon, which is involved in the activation of &sigma;<sup>G</sup> in the forespore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Stragier2">Stragier and Losick 1996</xref>). The operon is transcribed from two &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled promoters, one located immediately upstream of the operon and one preceding the next upstream gene, <italic>yqhV</italic>. As we have shown, both promoters are turned off shortly after their activation; one by SpoIIID and the other by GerR.</p>        <table-wrap id="pbio-0020328-t004" position="float">

&sigma;<sup>K</sup>: <italic>bofA, spoIVCA, spoIVCB, spoIVFA,</italic> and <italic>spoIVFB</italic>. Two of these genes <italic>(spoIVCA</italic> and <italic>spoIVCB)</italic> are involved in the synthesis of the proprotein precursor, pro-&sigma;<sup>K</sup>, whereas the remaining three <italic>(bofA</italic>, <italic>spoIVFA,</italic> and <italic>spoIVFB)</italic> are involved in the conversion of the proprotein to mature &sigma;<sup>K</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Cutting5">Cutting et al. 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Ricca1">Ricca et al. 1992</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>bofA</italic>, <italic>spoIVFA,</italic> and <italic>spoIVFB</italic> are repressed by SpoIIID, whereas <italic>spoIVCA</italic> and <italic>spoIVCB</italic> are switched on by SpoIIID, in this context acting as an activator. Hence, and ironically, genes involved in the processing of pro-&sigma;<sup>K</sup> are expressed in a pulse that precedes the time of activation of the genes involved in the synthesis of the substrate for processing.</p>        <p>How can we explain these seemingly anomalous observations? BofA, SpoIVFA, and SpoIVFB are integral membrane proteins that form a complex in the mother-cell membrane that surrounds the forespore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Resnekov1">Resnekov et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Rudner1">Rudner and Losick 2002</xref>). Evidence indicates that they initially localize to the cytoplasmic membrane that surrounds the mother cell and then reach their final destination by diffusion to, and capture at, the outer forespore membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Rudner2">Rudner et al. 2002</xref>). Such a diffusion-and-capture mechanism requires that the synthesis of BofA, SpoIVFA, and SpoIVFB takes place prior to the completion of engulfment since the outer membrane surrounding the forespore has become topologically isolated from the cytoplasmic membrane once engulfment is complete. Conversely, no such restriction applies to pro-&sigma;<sup>K</sup> (a peripheral membrane protein) whose synthesis is delayed (by virtue of being under the positive control of SpoIIID) relative to that of the integral membrane proteins. Strikingly, and in extension of these observations, a high proportion of &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled genes that encode proteins with predicted transmembrane segments are negatively regulated by SpoIIID and GerR. We speculate that many of these genes encode proteins that localize to the outer forespore membrane and do so by a diffusion-and-capture mechanism. Hence their synthesis is restricted to the time prior to the completion of engulfment. By contrast, &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled genes that are unaffected by SpoIIID and GerR, or are activated by SpoIIID, rarely encode proteins with predicted transmembrane segments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>).</p>        <p>As a final example of the coordinate expression of genes with related function we consider the case of <italic>cwlC</italic> and <italic>cwlH,</italic> which are switched on in the terminal phase of differentiation under the positive control of GerE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Kuroda1">Kuroda et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Smith4">Smith and Foster 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Nugroho1">Nugroho et al. 1999</xref>). The <italic>cwlC</italic> and <italic>cwlH</italic> genes encode cell-wall hydrolases that are responsible for the lysis of the mother cell when morphogenesis is complete so that the mature spore can be liberated from the sporangium. It is of crucial importance that mother-cell lysis not take place prematurely, and thus it makes sense that genes involved in this process are among the last genes to be turned on in the mother-cell line of gene expression.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s3d">        <title>Some Functionally Related Gene Classes Exhibit Heterogeneous Patterns of Gene Expression</title>        <p>Many of the genes in the mother-cell line of gene expression are known or inferred to be involved in metabolism, assembly of the spore coat, or the synthesis of coat-associated polysaccharides (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020328-t004">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, not all of the genes in these categories are coordinately expressed. Rather, genes in all three categories exhibit heterogeneous patterns of expression. Thus, among genes inferred to be involved in metabolism, some, such as members of the <italic>yngJIHGFE</italic> operon, which are expected to govern lipid catabolism, and members of the <italic>yjmCD&ndash;uxuA&ndash;yjmF&ndash;exuTR</italic> operon, which are expected to direct hexuronate synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Mekjian1">Mekjian et al. 1999</xref>), are expressed early in development, whereas other genes, such as the members of the <italic>yitCD</italic> and <italic>yitBA</italic>&ndash;<italic>yisZ</italic> operons, which are inferred to be involved in phosphosulfolactate synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Graham1">Graham et al. 2002</xref>), are expressed late in development. Sulfolactate is indeed known to be a major component of the dry weight (5&percnt;) of mature spores of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> but is not found in spores of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. megaterium</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. cereus</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Bonsen1">Bonsen et al. 1969</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. cereus</named-content> lacks an ortholog of the <italic>yitCD</italic> operon. Interestingly, the gene for <italic>asnO,</italic> which encodes an asparagine synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Yoshida1">Yoshida et al. 1999</xref>), is under the positive control of three of the five mother-cell-specific transcription factors (&sigma;<sup>E</sup>, &sigma;<sup>K</sup>, and SpoIIID) and the negative control of GerE, and hence its expression is maintained until very late in development.</p>        <p>Of special interest are genes involved in the assembly of the coat, the most conspicuous morphological feature of the mature spore. The coat is a complex, two-layered structure that creates a protective shield around the spore and is composed of at least 30 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Driks1">Driks 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Kuwana1">Kuwana et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Takamatsu1">Takamatsu and Watabe 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Lai1">Lai et al. 2003</xref>). The earliest-acting protein in the formation of the coat is SpoIVA, which creates a substratum around the outer forespore membrane upon which assembly of the coat takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Roels1">Roels et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Stevens2">Stevens et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Driks2">Driks et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Price2">Price and Losick 1999</xref>). In keeping with its early role in the assembly process, the gene for SpoIVA is switched on early in the mother-cell line of gene expression under the control of &sigma;<sup>E</sup> and is then turned off by the action of SpoIIID. The &sigma;<sup>E</sup> factor also turns on the genes for at least five other coat proteins that play important roles in coat assembly (<italic>cotE, cotH, safA, spoVM,</italic> and <italic>spoVID;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Piggot2">Piggot and Losick 2002</xref>)<italic>,</italic> but expression of these genes persists longer than that for <italic>spoIVA</italic> as none of these is repressed by SpoIIID. In fact, <italic>cotE</italic> and <italic>cotH</italic> continue to be expressed at even higher levels later in development under the control of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>, eventually being downregulated by GerE. In the case of <italic>cotE,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Li1">Li and Piggot (2001)</xref> have shown that transcription from its &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-dependent promoter P1 ceases before the activation of &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. Interestingly, certain temporal classes of mother-cell-specific genes are particularly enriched in coat protein genes. For instance, almost half of the &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled genes that are strongly or partially dependent on SpoIIID for expression (i.e., ten out of 25; C. F., P. E., and R. L., unpublished data) code for coat proteins. Similarly, our preliminary cytological data (C. F., P. E., and R. L., unpublished data) indicate that many of the newly identified &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-controlled genes encode coat-associated proteins.</p>        <p>In addition to being composed of many different proteins, the coat is composed of polysaccharides. Playing an important role in the synthesis of these polysaccharides is the 11-gene <italic>sps</italic> operon, the longest of the 236 mother-cell-specific transcription units identified in this study. The <italic>sps</italic> operon is transcribed from a &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-controlled promoter, which we have mapped to a site just upstream of the first gene in the operon, <italic>spsA</italic>. Transcription from this promoter is enhanced by the appearance of GerE but is not dependent upon it. Thus, expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of spore-coat polysaccharides persists until the very late stages of sporulation, in keeping with the idea that these polysaccharides are a component of the outer surface of the spore. Nevertheless, some genes in the <italic>sps</italic> operon are switched on early in sporulation under the control of &sigma;<sup>E</sup>, most likely from a second promoter located upstream of the seventh gene in the operon, <italic>spsG</italic>. Hence <italic>spsG</italic> and the genes downstream of it exhibit a protracted pattern of expression that persists throughout the entire process of differentiation.</p>        <p>The <italic>sps</italic> operon may not be the only set of genes involved in the synthesis of coat-associated polysaccharides. We have identified several paralogs of members of the operon that contribute to the mother-cell line of gene expression. These include genes in the <italic>yfnED</italic> operon, which is switched on by &sigma;<sup>E</sup>, downregulated by GerR, and turned on again by &sigma;<sup>K</sup>. Another example is the <italic>yfnHGF</italic> operon, which is under the positive control of &sigma;<sup>K</sup> and GerE. Yet another example is a paralog of <italic>spsJ, yodU&ndash;ypqP,</italic> which is activated under the dual control of &sigma;<sup>K</sup> and GerE. Interestingly, in the strain used in this study (PY79), <italic>yodU</italic> and <italic>ypqP</italic> actually correspond respectively to the 5&prime; end and the 3&prime; end of a single gene. However, in strain 168, the gene formed by <italic>yodU</italic> and <italic>ypqP</italic> is interrupted by the prophage of the large temperate phage SP&beta;, thereby greatly separating <italic>ypqP</italic> from the sporulation promoter that would otherwise direct its transcription. It would be interesting to investigate whether the interruption of the <italic>yodU</italic>&ndash;<italic>ypqP</italic> gene by SP&beta; influences the polysaccharide composition of the spore coat.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s3e">        <title>The Mother-Cell Line of Gene Transcription in Other Endospore-Forming Bacteria</title>        <p>Endospore formation has been documented in many species of the low G&plus;C group of gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Stragier1">Stragier 2002</xref>). Two distantly related genera in that group, <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Clostridium,</italic> are able to sporulate, whereas several genera that are phylogenetically closer to <italic>Bacillus,</italic> such as <italic>Listeria</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus,</italic> do not sporulate. Remarkably, in genome regions of otherwise high conservation (synteny) to corresponding regions in <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> sporulation genes are missing from <italic>Listeria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Eichenberger2">Eichenberger et al. 2003</xref>) and <italic>Staphylococcus.</italic> It is likely that the common ancestor of all of these genera was an endospore-forming bacterium and that sporulation genes were deleted over time from genera that had adapted alternative modes of survival in their ecological niche or host in a manner that did not involve the need for a robust resting state.</p>        <p>To investigate further the evolutionary relatedness of the mother-cell differentiation program among endospore-forming species, we searched for the presence of orthologs of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> genes in the mother-cell line of gene expression in the genome sequences of the following species: <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. anthracis</named-content> (Ames strain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Read1">Read et al. 2003</xref>), <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. cereus</named-content> (ATCC14579) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Ivanova1">Ivanova et al. 2003</xref>), <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. halodurans</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Takami2">Takami et al. 2000</xref>), and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Oceanobacillus iheyensis</named-content> (HTE831) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Takami1">Takami et al. 2002</xref>); <named-content content-type="genus-species">Listeria monocytogenes</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. innocua</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Glaser1">Glaser et al. 2001</xref>); and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium acetobutylicum</named-content> (ATCC 824) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Nolling1">Nolling et al. 2001</xref>) and <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. perfringens</named-content> (strain 13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Shimizu1">Shimizu et al. 2002</xref>) (Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">S4</xref>).</p>        <p>First, we searched for orthologs of the mother-cell-specific transcription factors. Interestingly, whereas genes for &sigma;<sup>E</sup>, &sigma;<sup>K</sup>, and SpoIIID were present in the <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Clostridium</italic> species, GerE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Stragier1">Stragier 2002</xref>) and GerR were absent from <italic>Clostridium,</italic> suggesting that significant differences exist in the mother-cell programs between the two genera, especially during the terminal (GerE-controlled) phase of gene expression. Nonetheless, in cases when a transcription factor was conserved between <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Clostridium,</italic> the protein domains involved in nucleotide-sequence recognition were also highly conserved, indicating that the consensus binding sequences that we described here are likely to be conserved among many, if not all, endospore-forming bacteria. For instance, the glutamine residue that recognizes the specificity determinant in the &minus;35 element of &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled promoters is absolutely conserved in all of the available &sigma;<sup>E</sup> protein sequences, and the corresponding arginine is conserved in all of the available &sigma;<sup>K</sup> protein sequences.</p>        <p>In addition to differences in the presence of certain mother-cell regulatory proteins (e.g., GerR and GerE) among endospore-forming species, the gene composition of the individual regulons also varies in a species-specific manner. In general, genes in the &sigma;<sup>E</sup> regulon appear to be more highly conserved than genes in the &sigma;<sup>K</sup> regulon. For instance, approximately 75&percnt; of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-controlled transcription units have orthologs in <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. anthracis</named-content> and <italic>B. cereus,</italic> whereas only 50&percnt; of the &sigma;<sup>K</sup>-controlled transcription units do.

An appealing explanation for the lower level of conservation among &sigma;<sup>K</sup> regulons is that genes switched on late in the mother-cell line of gene expression are enriched for genes encoding components of the outer surface of the spore&mdash;proteins that are likely to undergo the greatest evolutionary adaptation to the ecological niche in which a particular species is found. Indeed, experiments involving the use of atomic force microscopy reveal that the surfaces of the spores of the closely related species <italic>B. subtilis, B. anthracis,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. cereus</named-content> exhibit quite distinctive landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Chada1">Chada et al. 2003</xref>).</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s3f">        <title>Conclusions</title>        <p>We have provided a comprehensive description of the program of gene transcription for a single differentiating cell type and have shown that this program is governed by a regulatory circuit involving the action of five transcriptional control proteins acting as activators or repressors or both. The underlying logic of the circuit is that of a linked series of coherent and incoherent type-1 FFLs involving two-way combinations of the five regulatory proteins. The circuit is expected to create pulses of gene transcription in which large numbers of genes are switched on and subsequently switched off. We anticipate that type-1 FFLs linked in series are likely to be a common feature of programs of cellular differentiation in a wide variety of developing systems.</p>      </sec>    </sec>    <sec id="s4">      <title>Materials and Methods</title>      <sec id="s4a"><title/>        <sec id="s4a1">          <title>Strains</title>          <p>All strains used here are derivatives of the wild-type strain PY79, with the exception of the &sigma;<sup>K</sup> overproducing strain, which is a derivative of strain 168.

(2004)</xref>. The program can also be used for motifs consisting of two conserved blocks connected with a variable-length gap of unconserved nucleotides, and BioProspector can also be forced to find sites in every input sequence. Since BioProspector is a stochastic algorithm, more than one possible motif can be found, and since the program requires the motif width to be fixed, several different fixed widths should be used in the usual case where the motif width is not known. Thus, we collected the top five Bioprospector motifs under a range (6&ndash;12 bps) of seven fixed widths, giving a total of 35 putative motifs.</p>          <p>BioOptimizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Jensen1">Jensen and Liu 2004</xref>) is an optimization program designed to improve the results of each discovered BioProspector motif and to score each motif so that the &ldquo;best&rdquo; putative motif can be selected out of the 35 we discovered. The scoring function used is the exact log-posterior density of the Bayesian motif-discovery model given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Jensen1">Jensen and Liu (2004)</xref>. Starting from the set of sites predicted by BioProspector, the scoring function is optimized by accepting the addition of new motif sites or removal of current motif sites only if these changes increase the score. BioOptimizer also has the flexibility to allow the motif width to vary, so that the &ldquo;best&rdquo; width can also be determined. As well, BioOptimizer can be restricted to force particular sequences in the dataset to contain at least one site while leaving other sequences unrestricted. This property was utilized in our SpoIIID motif search, where a subset of sequences has additional biochemical evidence that they contain at least one SpoIIID-binding site.</p>          <p>Having found an optimal motif with our combined BioProspector/BioOptimizer procedure, we implemented an additional scanning procedure to find more potential SpoIIID sites.

considered the site in each sequence with the largest Strength value to be the best candidate as an additional site. If a sequence already contained a site found by our motif-discovery procedure, we would expect that this same site would be the one with the largest Strength value. For any sequence that did not have an optimal site found by the motif-discovery procedure, this scanning procedure gave us new site predictions. However, for any new sites found by the scanning procedure, one must be cautious about the strength of these sites, since the procedure found sites in each sequence regardless of how well those sites matched our optimal motif. Therefore, we also calculated a <italic>p</italic>-value for each site by comparing the Strength value calculated for that site to the Strength value calculated for 10,000 random sequences. Only sites with low <italic>p</italic>-values were considered as potential sites. With the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, we considered only sites with <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.000183.</p>      </sec>      <sec id="s4a11">        <title>MDscan analysis of the SpoIIID-binding motif</title>        <p>We used the word-enumeration algorithm &ldquo;MDscan&rdquo; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020328-Liu2">Liu et al. 2002</xref>) to identify motifs in sequences most enriched by immunoprecipitation experiments. In this algorithm, it is assumed that the most enriched sequences have stronger motif signals than the remaining sequences. MDscan first identifies oligomers of width <italic>w</italic> (<italic>w</italic>-mers) in the top sequences, which are used as seed oligomers. Motif matrices are constructed for each seed oligomer using all similar segments from the top sequences. Segments are defined to be similar if they share at least <italic>m</italic> matched positions, with <italic>m</italic> determined so that the probability that a pair of randomly produced <italic>w</italic>-mers are <italic>m</italic>-matches is less than 0.15&percnt;.
